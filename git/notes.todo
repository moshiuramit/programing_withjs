      ☐ cat notes.todo | wc -w (count the number of words in the file )
      ☐ cat notes.todo new.todo | wc -w (count the number of words in the files )
      ☐ ls | wc -w  (count the number of files )


    Redirection :
      ☐ everything in unix is file

      ☐ input represented by 0 ; use less than < 
      ☐ output represented by 1; use greater than > 
      ☐ error stream 2>; 2 followed by the greater than sign
      ☐ ls -l notexits/dir > error.txt
